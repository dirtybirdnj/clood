# clood Haikus

Poetry for the local LLM journey.

---

## Session 1 - Hardware Optimization

```
Silicon whispers
Vulkan flames kiss Polaris
Tokens flow like streams

Cache lines align true
Governor wakes from slumber
Five gigahertz hums

Memory mapped deep
Dirty pages flush at dawn
Throughput finds its way

Batch size grows with care
Context windows stretch and yawn
Latency retreats

Thread pools spin in dance
NUMA nodes share their secrets
Inference complete

Swap sleeps undisturbed
Huge pages hold the model
RAM becomes the throne

Heat spreads through the die
Thermal paste bridges the gap
Cooling fans respond
```

---

## Session 2 - The Server Garden

```
I. The Server Garden

Machines in the mist
Ollama blooms on each node
One proxy, all dreams


II. The Golden Idol

Swap disk for sandbag
NixOS config is the map
Rebuild anywhere


III. The Benchmark Quest

Powersave sleeps deep
One eighty-four tokens flow
Performance awaits
```

---

## Session 3 - Frankenstein & Dogfooding

```
I. The Monster Lives

Spare parts assembled
GPUs from different friends
Lightning brings it life


II. The Creator's Burden

I built you from scraps
Now you answer my questions
Who teaches whom now?


III. It Speaks

"It's alive!" I cry
But the model just responds:
"I am an AI"


IV. Dogfooding

Eat your own cooking
Test the tools you build for dogs
Become the good boy


V. The Test Subject

clood tests itself
Agents modify their home
Recursion is fun


VI. Trust the Process

Break it, fix it, push
Your own repo bleeds for you
Ship what you would use
```

---

## Session 4 - The Singularity Session

```
I. Keys Exchange

Ed25519
Mac to Ubuntu handshake
Claude reaches through

II. The Singularity

"Can you SSH in?"
Claude touches local hardware
Skynet begins small

III. Benchmarks at Dusk

One eighty-four speaks
TinyLlama races ahead
Groq trails at thirty-seven

IV. The Dashboard Dream

tmux splits the screen
btop left and nvtop right
Panes watch the machine

V. Thermal Wisdom

lm-sensors wake
Silicon runs hot with thought
Fans spin the reply

VI. Governor's Call

Performance mode set
Powersave no longer rules
Five gigahertz roars

VII. Proof of Concept

Simple start is best
Two panes prove the pattern works
Complexity waits
```

## Session 5 - Late Night Clood & Letting Go

```
I. The Approach

boat approaches falls
tokens are desired for two days
there is another way down


II. The Tools

pipes chain through the night
mods whispers, ollama hums—
context finds its way

local silicon
burns quiet beneath the desk
no meter running

clood-ask awaits
gathering git and files first—
then the model speaks


III. Everything Given

one hundred percent
nothing wasted, every drop
is there one more left?

step back from the glow
the code will wait, the body
knows what it needs now


IV. The Heart Speaks

broken heart still hurts
over a year it won't heal
pain of loss still now

why did she leave me
I know some reasons but she
would not say it is over

I stood in the frame
told me how she felt without
saying any words

can't let go of you
already a season gone
still searching for me

wheels turn without grain
searching for a better way
feed soul love get paid


V. Response

the frame holds the space
where answers should have been said
silence echoes long

grief has no deadline
seasons turn, the ache remains
healing isn't straight
```
