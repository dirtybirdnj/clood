# clood Haikus

Poetry for the local LLM journey.

## Session 1 - Hardware Optimization

```
Silicon whispers
Vulkan flames kiss Polaris
Tokens flow like streams

Cache lines align true
Governor wakes from slumber
Five gigahertz hums

Memory mapped deep
Dirty pages flush at dawn
Throughput finds its way

Batch size grows with care
Context windows stretch and yawn
Latency retreats

Thread pools spin in dance
NUMA nodes share their secrets
Inference complete

Swap sleeps undisturbed
Huge pages hold the model
RAM becomes the throne

Heat spreads through the die
Thermal paste bridges the gap
Cooling fans respond
```

## Session 2 - The Server Garden

```
I. The Server Garden

Machines in the mist
Ollama blooms on each node
One proxy, all dreams


II. The Golden Idol

Swap disk for sandbag
NixOS config is the map
Rebuild anywhere


III. The Benchmark Quest

Powersave sleeps deep
One eighty-four tokens flow
Performance awaits
```
