# Intel Core i7-8086K

> *Five gigahertz hums*
> *Forty years since eighty-six*
> *Won, not bought—still screams*

## The Story

This CPU was won in an Intel giveaway contest - a limited edition chip released to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the original Intel 8086 processor (1978-2018). Only 8,086 units were produced, making it a collector's item that also happens to be a beast of a processor.

## Specifications

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Model** | Intel Core i7-8086K |
| **Codename** | Coffee Lake |
| **Release** | Q2 2018 (40th Anniversary Edition) |
| **Process** | 14nm++ |
| **Cores** | 6 physical |
| **Threads** | 12 (Hyper-Threading) |
| **Base Clock** | 4.0 GHz |
| **Max Turbo** | 5.0 GHz (single core) |
| **All-Core Turbo** | 4.3 GHz |
| **L3 Cache** | 12 MB SmartCache |
| **TDP** | 95W |
| **Memory** | DDR4-2666 (dual channel) |
| **PCIe** | 3.0, 16 lanes |
| **iGPU** | Intel UHD Graphics 630 |

## Instruction Set Support

| Feature | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| SSE4.1/4.2 | ✅ |
| AVX | ✅ |
| AVX2 | ✅ |
| AVX-512 | ❌ |
| AES-NI | ✅ |
| VT-x | ✅ |
| VT-d | ✅ |

**Note:** AVX2 is used by llama.cpp for SIMD acceleration. AVX-512 would provide additional speedup but is only available on newer Intel chips (10th gen+).

## What Makes It Special

1. **Pre-binned Silicon** - Intel hand-selected the best i7-8700K dies that could hit 5GHz reliably
2. **Guaranteed 5GHz** - First consumer Intel chip to hit 5GHz out of the box
3. **Limited Production** - Only 8,086 units made (matching the original 8086 name)
4. **Collector's Item** - Came in special anniversary packaging

## Current System Configuration

**Machine:** ubuntu25
**Motherboard:** (check with `sudo dmidecode -t baseboard`)
**RAM:** 64GB DDR4
**GPU:** AMD Radeon RX 590 8GB
**Storage:** (check with `lsblk`)

## Performance Tuning

### CPU Governor

Ubuntu defaults to `powersave` governor, throttling this 5GHz chip to ~3.2GHz!

```bash
# Check current governor
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Switch to performance (temporary)
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Make permanent
sudo apt install linux-tools-common linux-tools-$(uname -r)
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```

### Overclocking Potential

The i7-8086K is unlocked (K-series) and can typically achieve:
- **5.0 GHz all-core** with good cooling
- **5.1-5.2 GHz** on best samples with custom loop cooling

**Current Status:** Running at stock settings with performance governor.

### Hyper-Threading Considerations

For llama.cpp / Ollama:
- Use **6 threads** (physical cores), not 12
- Hyper-Threading causes contention in lockstep threading models
- Set `OLLAMA_NUM_THREAD=6` for CPU-bound workloads

## LLM Performance Expectations

With RX 590 (Vulkan) + i7-8086K:

| Model | GPU Layers | Speed |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| TinyLlama 1.1B | 100% GPU | ~150 tok/s |
| Qwen 3B | 100% GPU | ~64 tok/s |
| Qwen 7B | 100% GPU | ~32 tok/s |
| Qwen 14B | ~50% GPU | ~15-20 tok/s |
| 33B+ | ~20% GPU | 5-8 tok/s |

The 64GB RAM allows larger models to spill to CPU without hitting swap.

## Benchmarking Commands

```bash
# CPU info
lscpu | grep -E "Model name|CPU\(s\)|Thread|Core|MHz|Cache"

# Current frequencies
watch -n1 "cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq | sort -u"

# Temperature monitoring (if sensors installed)
sensors | grep -i core

# Full system benchmark
ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b "Write a function to sort an array" --verbose 2>&1 | tail -10
```
