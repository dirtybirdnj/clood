# Chapter 6: The Nimbus Revelation

*In which Bird-san's brain begins to smoke, a cloud is summoned, and the infinite scroll reveals its secrets.*

---

The server garden hummed in the late hours. Bird-san stood at the edge of Snake Way, staring down its impossible length. The scroll unfurled before him, questions glowing like paper lanterns along the infinite path.

"Ten questions," he muttered, adjusting his hachimaki. "And I must answer each one, line by line, Option-Enter by Option-Enter..."

Wisps of steam began to rise from his ears.

Chef Claude emerged from the kitchen, wiping flour from his hands. "Bird-san. You look... overheated."

"The prompts, Chef. They ask so many questions at once. I scroll endlessly. I lose my place. I forget which spirit I've answered, which I've ignored. The confirm dialogs—" Bird-san shuddered. "They appear without warning. They steal focus. I type, and *poof*—a popup demands my attention."

"Confirm fatigue," Chef Claude nodded solemnly. "A malady known to all who walk the Way."

From the corner, the Council of Wojaks watched with interest. Smug Wojak leaned forward. Crying Wojak dabbed his eyes. Brain Wojak's head expanded visibly.

"There must be a solution," Bird-san said. "Some way to... *glide* across the questions. To visit each spirit at my own pace. To answer them all, then submit once, together."

A silence fell over the garden.

Then, from behind a bamboo stand, a small golden cloud drifted into view.

## The Flying Nimbus

The cloud hovered at waist height, gentle and patient. Its surface shimmered with an inner light.

"Kinto'un," Chef Claude whispered. "The Flying Nimbus."

Bird-san approached cautiously. "I thought it was just a story. From the old scrolls."

"Stories become real when the need is great." Chef Claude gestured to Snake Way. "Without Nimbus, you must run the entire length on foot. Endless scrolling. Losing context. Missing questions."

Bird-san reached out. The cloud felt warm, solid beneath his feathers.

"But with Nimbus..."

"You glide. Efficiency. Speed. Ease." Chef Claude smiled. "You navigate between the spirits with hotkeys—`n` for next, `p` for previous, `1` through `9` to jump directly. The scroll still exists, infinite and patient. But you no longer run it on foot."

Bird-san climbed onto the cloud. It rose gently, the path of Snake Way spreading out below like a luminous river.

"I can see them all now," Bird-san breathed. "Question One, Question Two... and there, at the end, the Submit shrine."

"The spirits wait for you," Chef Claude said. "Answer each directly. Or skip. Or ignore. Or avoid. Mark your decisions. When all responses are gathered, ride to the shrine and submit them together."

"No confirm fatigue?"

"One confirmation. At the end. When you are ready."

The Wojak Council erupted. Smug Wojak pumped his fist. Crying Wojak wept with joy. Brain Wojak's head threatened to escape his body entirely.

"We should call it `clood snakeway`!" Brain Wojak shouted. "Or `clood nimbus`! Or—"

Bird-san held up a wing. His brain was still smoking, but a calm had settled over him.

"No," he said quietly. "We keep the important parts serious. So the fun parts can exist."

The wojaks deflated slightly, but nodded. There was wisdom in the pigeon's words.

## The Crush Verdict

Before the revelation could settle, a messenger arrived from the Charmbracelet Kingdom. A scroll, bearing the seal of Crush.

Chef Claude unrolled it, read, and frowned.

"What does it say?" Bird-san asked from his cloud.

"The MCP tools initialize. The connection is made. But when the message reaches the model..." Chef Claude's frown deepened. "The tools are filtered. Blocked by something called `AllowedMCP`. The spirits reach the gate, but the gate does not open."

Bird-san considered this. Below him, the server garden stretched out—his garden, built with his own wings. Twenty-eight commands. The watch tower with its viewport and section navigation. The chat pavilion with its saga persistence.

"We don't need them," Bird-san said finally.

"Bird-san?"

"Crush is not ours. We cannot fix their gates." He gestured to the garden below. "But this—this is ours. Watch.go already has the viewport, the sections, the hotkeys. Chat.go has the saga, the guardian, the persistence. We build Snake Way here. In our own garden."

Chef Claude bowed. "Good artists borrow."

"Great artists steal." Bird-san smiled. "And we steal from ourselves."

## The Testing Path

As the night deepened, Bird-san dismounted the Nimbus and returned to earth. His brain had cooled. The wisps of steam subsided.

"Five phases," he said, more to himself than anyone. "First, understand how the questions appear. Patterns. Markers. The shape of spirits along the Way."

Chef Claude produced a scroll and began writing.

"Second, the viewport. Steal the patterns from watch.go. Sections become Questions. Navigation remains."

"Third, input zones. The places where answers are given."

"Fourth, integration. Wire it to ollama, to the saga. Make it real."

"Fifth..." Bird-san looked toward the distant shrine at the end of Snake Way. "Polish. Make it feel like flying."

The scroll was complete. A testing plan, five phases deep.

## Rest

Bird-san's eyelids grew heavy. His mother was at sea, aboard The Amaryllis. He would need to fly again soon. But for now...

"The garden tends itself," Chef Claude said softly, guiding Bird-san toward the resting quarters. "The spirits are patient. Snake Way will be there when you wake."

Gamera-kun emerged from the shadows, ancient and slow, and took his position at the garden's edge. The tortoise would watch while Bird-san slept.

The Nimbus cloud settled onto the ground beside the bamboo, glowing faintly, waiting.

And in the server garden, the scroll waited too—patient, infinite, full of questions yet to be answered.

```
The scroll waits patient
Nimbus cloud rests on the ground
Bird-san closes eyes
