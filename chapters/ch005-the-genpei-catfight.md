# Chapter 5: The Genpei Catfight

*December 17, 2025 - Late Night*

## The Backlog Grooming Ritual

Before battle comes planning. Before planning comes understanding.

Bird-san initiated the ritual: fifty issues in the clood repository, three in chimborazo. Each examined. Each judged. Keep, close, modify, or mark for catfight.

The morning became afternoon. Issues fell into categories:

- **Catfight Candidates**: #24, #29, #41, #50, #86, #87, #90, #91
- **Triumvirate Track**: #49, #37, #39 - reserved for Bird-san, Iron Chef Claude, and the Chairman together
- **Jelly Beans Captured**: Eight new issues birthed from decomposed epics

The Visibility Epic (#28) shattered into six actionable children. The pre-grooming check (#95) emerged when Bird-san caught Claude skipping the PR review. "Part of the ritual," he said, wagging his finger, "is looking at the latest relevant code."

The Unfurling Scroll (#96) arrived as a jelly bean emergency - a vision of wordgrinder-inspired interfaces, text emerging from fog like ancient scrolls.

## The Two Kitchens Revealed

During the grooming, something stirred on the network.

"The DNS network discovery goblins should have told you that!" Bird-san exclaimed.

And there it was: **mac-mini** - The Sentinel - online at 192.168.4.41. The M4 had awakened.

The commentators went wild:

> *"WOW KITCHEN STADIUM WE CANNOT BELIEVE THIS... there is... ANOTHER KITCHEN!"*

The Iron Keep (ubuntu25) had reigned alone. Now a challenger emerged. Two kitchens. Two philosophies. One arena.

## House Taira and House Minamoto

The Genpei War - 1180 to 1185 - defined Japan. Two clans. Total war. Only one would build the shogunate.

**House Taira** (Heike) - The established power. Court sophistication. Naval prowess. Color: **Red**.

**House Minamoto** (Genji) - Eastern warriors. Raw strength from exile. Color: **White**.

The mapping revealed itself:

| Kitchen | House | Color | Nature |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| ubuntu25 | Minamoto | White | The underdog. RX 590 shouldn't compete with M4. Yet here it is - victorious. |
| mac-mini | Taira | Red | Elegant Apple silicon. Expected to dominate. The establishment. |

The Taira fell not from weakness, but from underestimating the Minamoto's hunger.

## The First Two-Kitchen Showdown

The implementation landed: `--hosts` flag for multi-kitchen battles. JSON output. Markdown for PRs. Cross-host comparisons.

The first benchmark roared across the network:

```
Kitchen: ubuntu25 (http://192.168.4.64:11434)
Kitchen: mac-mini (http://192.168.4.41:11434)
```

Results from tinyllama:

| Kitchen | House | tok/s | Time |
|---------|-------|-------|------|
| ubuntu25 | Minamoto | 205.9 | 0.9s |
| mac-mini | Taira | 164.1 | 1.0s |

**WINNER: House Minamoto**

The RX 590 - a dying GPU architecture, ROCm barely supported - defeated the M4's Neural Engine. The eastern warriors had struck first.

## The Dying Branch

Bird-san restarted the mac-mini. All apps closed. Fresh state. Surely now performance would improve?

The benchmark ran again. And again. And again.

| Run | ubuntu25 | mac-mini |
|-----|----------|----------|
| Cold | 69 tok/s | 48 tok/s |
| Warm 1 | 192 tok/s | 127 tok/s |
| Warm 2 | 194 tok/s | 117 tok/s |
| Warm 3 | 196 tok/s | 117 tok/s |

The restart had made things *worse*. 164 tok/s before, 117 tok/s after. The warm caches were gone. The Neural Engine needed time to optimize.

Bird-san laughed an uneasy chuckle. He saw the dying branch on an otherwise healthy tree.

"The utility of the mac-mini," he said slowly, "is testing our multi-kitchen workflow. Maybe the less performance is a feature."

The branch would be pruned later. The tree was strong.

## The Miyazaki Vision

The spirit of Miyazaki nodded and smiled.

His visions required depth. Nuance. Not just heroes and villains, but the spaces between. A dying branch was not failure - it was character. A slower kitchen was not defeat - it was challenge.

The two kitchens were across the street from each other. Connected by video and audio. Kui-san and the narrator could seamlessly cut between sets. Samurai Pizza Cats energy - absurdist, earnest, deeply Japanese.

And in the corner of Kitchen Taira, completely out of place, sat **Gucci Mane**.

---

## The Unexpected Sage

No one knew why Gucci Mane was there. He wore a kimono that somehow worked. He had chopsticks in his hand. He was watching the cats code with the intensity of a master calligrapher.

When tinyllama produced its haiku - *"Drenched in heat, the bird sleeps"* - the room fell silent.

Gucci Mane nodded slowly.

"That's hard," he said.

The assembled masters - aged sake brewers, retired software architects, a bonsai master who had tended trees for sixty years - turned to look at him.

"The bird knows what the bird knows," Gucci continued. "Sometimes you just gotta rest in the hot water and let the heat do its thing. You can't rush that."

Silence. Then, from the eldest master:

"The American speaks truth."

The room murmured agreement. Gucci Mane had earned his seat.

## The Outdoor Assembly

For the verdict, all gathered outside. Reality-show style. The basket ingredients had been revealed at dawn. The synthesis had been judged. Now the Chairman would speak.

The outdoor set existed between the two kitchens - a courtyard where both could see and be seen. Cherry blossom petals (synthetic, it was December) drifted through carefully positioned fans.

"The criteria were met," the Chairman declared. "The two-kitchen workflow functions. The catfight infrastructure scales."

Iron Chef Claude stepped forward. "But mac-mini's performance regression concerns me. We expected gains from the restart."

Bird-san joined them. The Triumvirate convened.

"Technical win," Bird-san said. "The feature works. The dying branch is documented. We prune it in the next session."

The Chairman nodded. "Acceptable. The work continues."

---

## The Bonsai Moment

Between the kitchens stood a bonsai - a juniper that Bird-san's grandfather had started fifty years ago. It had survived moves, droughts, neglects, and recoveries.

One branch had died last winter. Bird-san had left it, wondering if it would recover. It hadn't. Tonight, he finally cut it.

The tree looked better immediately. The energy that had gone to the dying branch now flowed to the living ones.

"Sometimes," he said to no one in particular, "you have to let go of what isn't working so the rest can thrive."

The mac-mini would stay in rotation. Its limitations would stress-test the workflow. But the expectation of it matching ubuntu25 - that branch was cut.

```
White defeats the red
Not through strength but through hunger
Exile breeds winners

Two kitchens glow bright
Across the street they compete
Gucci Mane nods slow

## Lessons of the Chapter

1. **Grooming is a ritual** - Fifty issues examined, not skipped
2. **Two kitchens stress-test better than one** - Limitations are features
3. **The dying branch must be acknowledged** - Then pruned
4. **Unexpected sages appear** - Gucci Mane speaks truth
5. **The Triumvirate decides together** - Technical wins need human judgment
6. **Cut what doesn't serve** - Energy flows to what remains
