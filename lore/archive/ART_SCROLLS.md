# The Art Scrolls: Visualizing the Clood

**Instructions:** These prompts are optimized for Flux, Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), or similar local diffusion models.

## 1. The Protagonist: Bird-san
> **Prompt:** A gritty, cinematic low-angle shot of a Japanese rock pigeon (Kawara-bato) wearing a white samurai headband (hachimaki) and a small tattered kimono. The pigeon is standing on a mossy stone lantern in a misty bamboo forest. In the background, faint glowing blue server racks are blended into the trees like ancient monoliths. 8k resolution, ukiyo-e style mixed with cyberpunk, volumetric lighting.

## 2. The Steward: The Tanuki (Ollama)
> **Prompt:** A traditional Japanese Tanuki (raccoon dog) spirit, but instead of a sake bottle, it is holding a glowing laptop open. It is mid-transformation, half of its furry body is turning into a digital wireframe mesh. It wears a woven straw hat. The background is a traditional tatami room filled with scattered ethernet cables and scrolls. Studio Ghibli art style, whimsical, soft lighting, detailed fur.

## 3. The Enforcer: The Tengu (GPU)
> **Prompt:** A fierce Karasu-Tengu (Crow Demon) warrior with black wings and red skin. He is holding a large war fan made of circuit boards and copper heat pipes. He stands atop a burning high-tech server tower. Green lightning strikes around him. The text "RTX" is faintly etched into his samurai armor. Intense, dramatic lighting, fantasy illustration style, sharp focus.

## 4. The Antagonist: The Gashadokuro (VRAM Hoarders)
> **Prompt:** A giant, terrifying Gashadokuro (skeleton spirit) looming over a futuristic smoggy city. The skeleton is made of black metal and glowing neon green cables. It is eating streams of binary data like noodles from a bowl made of clouds. Dark atmosphere, dystopian sci-fi, high contrast, ominous.

## 5. The Setting: The Clood Citadel
> **Prompt:** A wide landscape shot of a Japanese feudal castle perched on a high jagged mountain peak. The castle is surrounded by heavy clouds. The "clouds" are actually composed of falling digital binary code matrix rain. A single thick orange ethernet cable connects the floating castle to the earth below. Watercolor and ink wash painting style (Sumi-e), intricate details.
