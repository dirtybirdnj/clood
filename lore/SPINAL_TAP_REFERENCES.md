### In Clood Context

When a jelly bean's scope keeps expanding, check the dial:

| Level | Size | Signal |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1-3 | XS | Quick fix, single file |
| 4-6 | S | Small feature, one session |
| 7-9 | M | Multi-file, needs planning |
| 10 | L | Epic, multiple sessions |
| **11** | **XL** | **You've got a Star Seed, not a bean** |

## "None More Black"

The clood terminal experience aspires to this standard. Clean. Minimal. None more black.

## The Stonehenge Moment

> *The band orders an 18-foot Stonehenge monument for the stage.*
> *Due to a mix-up, they receive an 18-inch model instead.*
> *Dwarves dance around it. It's embarrassing.*

### In Development

A **Stonehenge Moment** occurs when:
- Scope and implementation don't match
- What was envisioned as MASSIVE arrives as tiny
- Or worse: tiny scope balloons into crushing reality

**Warning Signs:**
```
Planned:   "Quick 2-hour fix"
Reality:   Three-day odyssey through legacy code

Planned:   "Complete AI pipeline overhaul"
Reality:   Changed one config value
```

**Prevention:**
1. Check the intensity dial
2. If it's at 11, it's a Star Seed
3. Star Seeds need containment rituals, not casual Fridays

## "Smell the Glove"

The controversial album cover that was ultimately released as a plain black sleeve.

### In Clood Context

Sometimes the documentation you write is so dense, so technical, so *intense* that:

> "What's wrong with being sexy?"
> "It's SEXIST."

The lesson: **Know your audience.**

The lore is for those who get it. The README is for everyone.

---

## "Jazz Odyssey"

When Derek Smalls performs an extended bass solo that clears the audience.

### In Development

A **Jazz Odyssey** occurs when:
- You go deep into implementation details
- Nobody asked for this
- The audience (users, stakeholders) visibly checks out
- You're having a great time but nobody else is

**Symptoms:**
- Spending 4 hours on config file aesthetics
- Building a custom logging framework when `print()` works
- Explaining git internals when they asked how to commit

---

## "Big Bottom"

> *Big bottom, big bottom*
> *Talk about mud flaps, my girl's got 'em*

### In Clood Context

Sometimes a feature has... *excessive lower complexity*. The UI is simple but the infrastructure is **THICC**.

This is fine. Celebrate the hidden complexity. The mud flaps keep the road clean.

## The Drummer Problem

Spinal Tap has lost numerous drummers to bizarre accidents:
- Spontaneous combustion
- Gardening accident
- Choking on vomit (not his own)

### In Development

**The Drummer Problem** = The component that keeps failing for mysterious reasons.

In clood:
- deepseek-r1:8b timing out (6 failures overnight)
- MCP connections dropping
- That one test that fails only on Tuesdays

**Solution:** Some drummers just can't be saved. Document the failures, move on.

The dial goes up

Star seeds are forged hot
