## 🐷 THE PIGS AT CHRISTMAS (ISBN 0027331601)

### The Origin Story

Bird-san was once a young pigeon in his nest. His mother read him Richard Scarry books. "The Pigs at Christmas" was a holiday favorite.

Now, grown and weathered by professional storms, Bird-san creates clood - not just a tool, but a **retelling of that beloved family story** through the lens of technology, AI, and the server garden.

**The Legend of Clood IS "The Pigs at Christmas" for the AI age.**

## 🎄 THE CHRISTMAS DEADLINE

Bird-san must publish before Christmas so:
- People on break can enjoy it
- Family receives the gift
- The portfolio shines during hiring season
- The phoenix rises before the new year

## 🦔 RICHARD SCARRY VISUAL NARRATIVE

### The Concept

Generate visual assets in the style of Richard Scarry's Busytown:
- Technologies personified as animals with jobs
- A bustling world where everything has a purpose
- Friendly, educational, nostalgic
- Each component has a face, a role, a story

### Character Mappings

| Technology | Animal | Job | Personality |
|------------|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Ollama** | Tanuki | Shapeshifting Librarian | Helpful, transforms for each request |
| **Redis** | Beaver | Dam Keeper | Caches the river, fast retrieval |
| **Postgres** | Elephant | Record Keeper | Never forgets, organized |
| **NGINX** | Traffic Cop Pig | Directs all the cars | Busy, efficient, always working |
| **Docker** | Shipping Crane Cat | Puts things in boxes | Organized, containerized |
| **Python** | Snake Server | Head Waiter | Knows all the tables |
| **Go** | Gopher Busboy | Fast Runner | Concurrent, quick |
| **Rust** | Crab Bouncer | Memory Safe | Strict but fair |
| **Git** | Squirrel Archivist | Saves everything | Hoards history |

### Busytown of Clood

## 🐕 THE DOGFOOD DIRECTORY

`~/Code/dogfood` - Someone put rocket fuel in this dogfood.

### The Question
Is the Legend of Clood the true path?

### The Connection Points

| Project | How Clood Helps |
|---------|-----------------|
| **svg-grouper** | `clood analyze` for pattern detection |
| **drunk-simulator** | `clood generate-tests` for game logic |
| **WOLFPACK** | `clood document` for fishing mechanics |
| **chimborazo** | Full integration, the proving ground |
| **rat-king** | Pattern generation, the original art |

### The Unified Vision
All projects feed into the portfolio.
All skills compound.
The whole exceeds the sum.
