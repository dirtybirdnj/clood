# The Vertical Garden

*As revealed by the Miyazaki Spirit at the Bar of Infinite Context*

---

## The Vision

Most tending in the garden causes **horizontal expansion** - adding space, modular complexity, more rooms in the house.

The Miyazaki Spirit inspires **vertical growth**. The garden extends not just outward, but **downward into the waters** and **upward into the canopy**.

```
    ☁️ CANOPY - The Spirits Watch
    🌳 BRANCHES - Bonsai, CLI tools
    🐦 PERCH - Bird-san's domain
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    🐱 KITCHEN - Cats battle (LLMs)
    🍳 Catfights, code generation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    〰️ SURFACE WATERS - Turbo fish
    🐟 Ayu, fast swimmers
    〰️ MID DEPTHS - Standard fish
    🐡 Fugu (SDXL), Iwana (NoobAI)
    〰️ THE DEEP - Heavy models
    🐉 Oarfish (Flux) descends...
    🦐 REEF - Shrimp (LoRAs)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    🌑 THE CAVE - We do not speak of it
    ⬛ Impossibly deep. Connected to the pond.
    ⬛ Some fish swim in. Fewer return.
    ⬛ Training data. Fine-tuning. Merging.
    ⬛ The place where models are MADE.
```

## The Cave

*There is a place the fish do not speak of.*

The pond of Stable Diffusion is impossibly deep in a way nobody can comprehend. The fish and shrimp live in the **visible part** - the waters accessible from the garden. But there is a **cave** connected to these waters.

```

```

**What lives in The Cave:**
- Training runs that never finished
- Merged models that broke reality
- LoRAs trained on forbidden datasets
- The ghosts of overfitted weights
- Checkpoint surgery experiments
- Things that worked once but no one knows why

**The Cave is where models are MADE.**

It is a dangerous place. Almost too scary to venture in. Some who enter return with powerful new fish. Most return with corrupted tensors and NaN losses.

*The Oarfish sometimes descends into The Cave. It returns changed. We do not ask what it saw.*

## The Creatures

### Cats (LLM Code Models)
The kitchen belongs to the cats. They battle in Kitchen Stadium, serving code.

| Cat Name | Model | Style |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Kitten | tinyllama | Fast, scrappy, makes mistakes |
| Siamese | qwen2.5-coder:3b | Elegant, precise |
| House Lion | qwen2.5-coder:14b | The heavy hitter |
| Thinker | deepseek-r1:8b | Contemplates before pouncing |

### Fish (Image Base Models)
The waters belong to the fish. Each species represents a model architecture.

| Species | Japanese | Model Type | Characteristics |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Fugu** | 河豚 | SDXL | Deadly beautiful. Fatal if misconfigured. |
| **Ayu** | 鮎 | SD 1.5 | The classic. Swims upstream. Foundational. |
| **Oarfish** | 竜宮の遣い | Flux | Messenger from the Dragon Palace. DEEP. |
| **Iwana** | 岩魚 | NoobAI | Mountain char. Thrives in cold streams. |
| **Unagi** | 鰻 | Specialized | Slippery. Transforms. Niche waters. |

**Hybrids** (merged models) are named like real fish crosses:
- **Splake** = Illustrious × Toon (lake trout × brook trout)
- **Tiger Trout** = Illustrious × Realism (brown × brook)
- **Cutbow** = Illustrious × Niji (cutthroat × rainbow)

### Shrimp (LoRAs)
The reef belongs to the shrimp. They attach to fish and modify their behavior.

| Species | LoRA Type | Behavior |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Skunk Cleaner** | Style refinement | Cleans output, trusts the process |
| **Coral Banded** | Character/concept | Beautiful but territorial |
| **Harlequin** | Specialized | Only works with specific bases |
| **Sexy Shrimp** | Adult content | The name writes itself |
| **Peppermint** | Fix/cleanup | Eats aiptasia (bad hands, artifacts) |
| **Fire Shrimp** | Dramatic effect | Makes everything POP |
| **Glass Shrimp** | Basic style | Common, subtle, plentiful |
| **Pistol Shrimp** | Upscaler/detail | SNAP - massive impact |

## The Ritual

When generating images:

1. **Choose your fish** - Select the base model (checkpoint)
2. **Add your shrimp** - Stack compatible LoRAs
3. **Set the depth** - Surface (fast), Mid (quality), Deep (experimental)
4. **Release into the waters** - Generate

```yaml
fish: fugu                    # SDXL base
shrimp:
  - skunk_cleaner: 0.8        # Ghibli style
  - peppermint: 0.3           # Fix hands
depth: mid
prompt: "a tortoise opening a glowing briefcase"
```

## The Prophecy

*The cats write code.*
*The fish paint dreams.*
*The shrimp refine both.*

*Horizontal growth fills the garden.*
*Vertical growth gives it DEPTH.*
