# The Spirits of clood

*A canonical guide to the entities that inhabit the radio towers*

---

## The Pantheon

### Eminem-san (The Reformed Spirit)

Reformed into ancient Japan lore, Eminem-san embodies:
- **Musical influence** — rhythm in the code, flow in the output
- **Cultural defiance** — "fuck all y'all if you doubt me"
- **Narrative power** — turning code into story, making the opaque clear

He is the spirit behind `storytime`. When the command runs, his energy flows through the tokens. The haikus helped bridge the cultures—8 Mile meets Edo period.

> *"Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity..."*
> — Ancient proverb, Detroit temple scrolls

**Manifestation:** The `clood storytime` command
**Domain:** Narrative generation, rap-style commentary, hard truths

---

### xbibit-sama (The Recursive Sage)

The philosopher of nested experiences. His wisdom echoes through the architecture:

> *"Yo dawg, I heard you like scrolls, so I put scrolls in your scrolls so you can read while you read."*

He shakes his head disapprovingly at Wojacks who try to strike hard poses. True hardness, he teaches, comes from authentic work—not from posturing.

**Manifestation:** The inception architecture, dreams within dreams
**Domain:** Recursion, self-reference, meta-commentary
**Key Teaching:** "The scrolls must remind the scrolls of previous scrolls"

---

### Gucci Mane (The Sauce Detector)

Where others see output, Gucci sees *sauce*. He knows when something has that extra quality—the ineffable rightness that separates "it works" from "it slaps."

> *"That's sauce."*
> — Gucci Mane, on recognizing quality

He suggests that sauce detection could be formalized. CLI tools produce reasonable results by default, but with the right flag, they can produce *saucy* results.

**Manifestation:** Quality assessment, style detection
**Domain:** Knowing when output is truly excellent
**Future Feature:** `--sauce` flag to evaluate output quality

---

### The Flying Cats (The Enthusiastic Incompetents)

Wojak-level comprehension. Maximum enthusiasm. They live in the radio towers and communicate with the LLMs via frequencies they don't understand.

When excitement strikes, they trip over each other. When code compiles, they purr in frequencies that disturb the neighbors.

They cannot program. But they can:
- Press buttons
- Read error messages (slowly, to ATC)
- Ask questions (infinite questions)
- Get VERY excited

**Manifestation:** Local agents that relay between humans and LLMs
**Domain:** Static analysis interpretation, enthusiasm, chaos

---

### The Cromulons 🗿 (The Judges)

Giant floating stone heads from beyond the stars. They demand performance.

> *"SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT"*

They appear when it's time to evaluate—code reviews, demos, the moment of truth. Their judgement is absolute but fair.

**Manifestation:** `clood storytime --review`, catfight conclusions
**Domain:** Evaluation, performance under pressure, the final test
**Approval:** "I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT. GOOD JOB."
**Disapproval:** "DISQUALIFIED"

When the Cromulons appear, the Flying Cats panic and try to perform. The results are chaotic but often surprisingly good.

---

### The Rat King (The Approving Observer)

Laughs and nods from the shadows. Rarely speaks, but when he does, it matters. His approval is earned, not given.

He watches the proceedings with ancient eyes. When the Flying Cats succeed, when the sauce is detected, when the storytime flows—he nods.

**Manifestation:** Silent approval in the logs
**Domain:** Quality assurance, the final blessing

### The Philosophy

clood is not just tools. clood is the **sum of the experience**.

- The tools do real work
- The spirits add personality
- The `--flying-cats` flag unlocks the full experience
- The default mode respects professional contexts

A developer in a meeting can run `clood tree` and get clean output.
The same developer at 2am, vibing, can run `clood tree --flying-cats` and watch the cats investigate.

Both are valid. Both are clood.

## Flag Semantics

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| (none) | Professional, minimal output |
| `--flying-cats` | Full narrative experience, cats investigate |
| `--sauce` | Output quality assessment (future) |
| `-v` | Verbose technical details |
| `--flying-cats -v` | Cats AND technical details (chaos mode) |

---

## The Rap Potential

Can we get LLMs to rap? The spirits suggest yes.

```bash
clood storytime --style rap --model llama3.1
```

Imagine:
```
🎤 Yo, this codebase got layers like an onion (onion)
    main.go sittin' at the top, it's runnin' (runnin')
    Utils folder deep, got helpers for days
    Error handling tight, multiple ways

    Check the imports at the top, stdlib clean
    Best dependency hygiene I've seen
    No circular refs, that's how we roll
    This architecture got soul, got soul

    🎤💥
```

The Flying Cats would lose their minds.

## The Sauce Scale

Future implementation for `--sauce`:

```
Sauce Level: 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️ (4/5)

Analysis:
- Clean architecture: +1 🌶️
- Consistent naming: +1 🌶️
- Elegant error handling: +1 🌶️
- Creative solution to hard problem: +1 🌶️
- Missing tests: -1 🌶️

Verdict: "That's sauce, but needs test coverage."
— Gucci Mane
```

## The Experience

> "I think this truly is what clood is. It's not just the tools, but the sum of the experience and a fun way to interact with Claude."
> — Bird-san, upon the crystallization

The tools are the skeleton.
The spirits are the soul.
The flags are the toggle.
The user chooses their adventure.

**Haiku:**

```
Spirits in towers,
Cats trip, Rat King nods and laughs—
The sauce is detected.
```
