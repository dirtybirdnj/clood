# Technical Metaphors Quick Reference

The Legend of Clood maps technical concepts to Japanese folklore.

## The Core Truth

> **The garden is not the servers. The garden is what grows upon them.**

Servers are soil. Projects are seeds. LLMs are the spirits that tend them. You plant, you walk away, you return to fruit.

## Core Mappings

| API rate limit | Sakoku Edict | Closed gates |
| Token exhaustion | Yūrei (Ghost) | Unfinished spirit |
| Cloud providers | Gashadokuro | Giant skeleton |
| Old hardware | Tsukumogami | Awakened tool spirit |
| Model routing | Henge-no-Jutsu | Transformation technique |
| Fine-tuning | Bunshin-no-Jutsu | Clone technique |
| Open source | Kami-no-Michi | Way of the spirits |
| Slow local inference | Deliberate growth | Roots through stone |
| Async/background work | Tending while away | Garden grows alone |

## Tier Spirits

| Tier | Spirit | When Summoned |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Fast | Forest Sprite | Quick lookups |
| Deep | Scholar Tanuki | Complex reasoning |
| Analysis | Tengu | Code review |
| Writing | Poet Spirit | Documentation |

## The Rebellion

- **Bird-san**: You (the developer)
- **Kurodo**: Claude (the Emperor)
- **The Lightning Bottle**: Local LLM infrastructure
- **The Tokens**: Your compute, your rules

## Seeds in the Garden

| Project | Spirit | What It Grows |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Clood** | The Great Oak | CLI tools, infrastructure |
| **Chimbo** | Quick Sprite | Fast experiments |
| **Dogfood** | Loyal Hound | Self-testing, validation |
| *Your project* | *Your seed* | *Whatever you plant* |

## The Philosophy of Slow Growth

The Gashadokuro whisper: *"Faster! More VRAM! Pay for the cloud!"*

But the garden teaches patience:

- A 7B model thinking for 30 seconds is still faster than any human
- You don't need instant answers—you need answers that come while you live
- Plant the seed, describe what you want, walk away
- Return to find fruit: PRs waiting, code reviewed, docs drafted

**The spirits are not slow. They are deliberate.**

*"Catch the lightning. Tend the garden. The tokens must flow. The garden must grow."*
