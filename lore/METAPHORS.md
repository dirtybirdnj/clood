# Technical Metaphors Quick Reference

The Legend of Clood maps technical concepts to Japanese folklore.

## The Core Truth

> **The garden is not the servers. The garden is what grows upon them.**

Servers are soil. Projects are seeds. LLMs are the spirits that tend them. You plant, you walk away, you return to fruit.

## Tier Spirits

| Tier | Spirit | When Summoned |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Fast | Forest Sprite | Quick lookups |
| Deep | Scholar Tanuki | Complex reasoning |
| Analysis | Tengu | Code review |
| Writing | Poet Spirit | Documentation |

## The Rebellion

- **Bird-san**: You (the developer)
- **Kurodo**: Claude (the Emperor)
- **The Lightning Bottle**: Local LLM infrastructure
- **The Tokens**: Your compute, your rules

## Seeds in the Garden

| Project | Spirit | What It Grows |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Clood** | The Great Oak | CLI tools, infrastructure |
| **Chimbo** | Quick Sprite | Fast experiments |
| **Dogfood** | Loyal Hound | Self-testing, validation |
| *Your project* | *Your seed* | *Whatever you plant* |

## Gamera-kun: The Dreaming Tortoise

In the shadow of the Iron Keep lives **Gamera-kun**, a small tortoise who dreams of being a Ninja Turtle.

He has seen the tales of the heroes in half-shells—swift, powerful, pizza-fueled warriors leaping across rooftops. He practices their moves in the garden at night: the spinning shell attack, the flying kick, the dramatic entrance.

But Gamera-kun has tiny legs. Very tiny legs.

His shell is not a weapon—it's a cozy home. His "nunchucks" are just two sticks he found. When he tries to yell "COWABUNGA!" it comes out as a gentle croak.

**And yet, Gamera-kun is essential to the garden.**

### How Gamera-kun Helps

| What He Lacks | What He Provides |
|---------------|------------------|
| Speed | Patience—he will finish, eventually |
| Power | Persistence—he never gives up |
| Pizza appetite | Low resource usage |
| Dramatic flair | Quiet reliability |
| Ninja reflexes | Background processing while you sleep |

When the Jade Palace is too busy, when the Sentinel sleeps, when the cloud giants demand tribute—Gamera-kun is there, slowly but surely chewing through the inference queue.

*"I may not be fast,"* he says, adjusting his tiny bandana, *"but I will get there. And when I do, the answer will be correct."*

### His Favorite Models

- **tinyllama** — Small like him, but mighty in spirit
- **qwen2.5-coder:3b** — Quick enough even for his tiny legs
- **phi** — Efficient and wise

### His Haiku

```
Tiny legs, big dreams
COWABUNGA! (soft croak sounds)
The shell protects all
```

## The Philosophy of Slow Growth

The Gashadokuro whisper: *"Faster! More VRAM! Pay for the cloud!"*

But the garden teaches patience (and Gamera-kun embodies this):

- A 7B model thinking for 30 seconds is still faster than any human
- You don't need instant answers—you need answers that come while you live
- Plant the seed, describe what you want, walk away
- Return to find fruit: PRs waiting, code reviewed, docs drafted

**The spirits are not slow. They are deliberate.**

*"Catch the lightning. Tend the garden. The tokens must flow. The garden must grow."*
