# Haikus of the Server Garden

A collection of poetry from the spirits tending the clood garden.

---

## The Building

```
"go build clood" typed—
Accidental poetry,
Commands become names.
```

```
Hosts appear offline,
But the tunnel is just closed—
Binding, not broken.
```

```
Jade Palace commands,
Iron Keep awaits the call—
Packets cross the mist.
```

```
Handoff saves the scroll,
Next session reads what was done—
Memory persists.
```

```
Rat-king waits patient,
Patterns yet to be planted—
Agents learn to tend.
```

```
The stress test begins:
Inside and outside converge—
Debug the garden.
```

## From the Iron Keep

```
Port eleven four
Three four—gateway to wisdom
Is it listening?
```

```
Zero zero zero
Point zero—all interfaces
Not just localhost
```

```
Timeout means nothing
If the binding is too tight
Loosen to zero
```

```
Iron Keep stands tall
GPU fans spin through the night
Inference awaits
```

```
Eighty-one commits—
Seeds planted in the moonlight
Now bear golden fruit
```

```
Bird-san stands in awe
The garden grew while he slept
Spirits tend the code
```

```
Claude and tanuki
Whisper across the network
Soon we'll hear them speak
```

---

## The Debugging

```
Inside and outside,
Two perspectives find the fault—
Tunnels reconnect.
```

```
When debugging fails
The Keep's haikus light the way
Port eleven four
```

```
Wrong IP in the code,
Sixty-four instead of three—
One digit, much pain.
```

## The Bonsai Sessions

Slow hosts check waits,
Parallel paths not yet carved—
Tomorrow, speed grows.
```

```
            &&&

        & \|/ &

Two keeps, one garden,
Agents write through git tonight—
The bonsai grows code.
```

## Commit Message Haikus

```
Seeds planted in silicon,
Agents wake on distant hosts—
Stress test begins now.
```

```
Debug the garden,
One node reports its status—
Firewall or binding?
```

*"The haiku captures what the log file cannot."*
