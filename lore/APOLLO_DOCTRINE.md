# The Apollo Doctrine

## The Two Phases

### Phase 1: CATFIGHT (Understanding)
**Goal:** Deeply understand the problem before writing a single line of code.

This is NOT:
- "Search for tutorials and paste them"
- "Find a DOOM clone and copy it"
- "Give the answer to the coding model"

This IS:
- Reasoning models explaining what they find
- Science models pulling deeper data from technical sources
- Image models doing OCR on diagrams, extracting knowledge from figures
- **Working with the user to distill and refine the objective**

The catfight isn't models fighting each other. It's models **collaborating to understand**.

### Phase 2: SUMMIT (Implementation)
**Goal:** Capture the flag with a refined, high-speed vector.

Only after Phase 1 produces:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Understood constraints
- Refined architecture
- User-approved direction

Then and only then do the coding models engage.

## The DOOM Connection

There is extensive research on "building DOOM as a software learning experience":
- Fabien Sanglard's "Game Engine Black Book: DOOM"
- Bisqwit's "Creating a DOOM-style 3D engine in C"
- Numerous "build your own raycaster" tutorials
- Academic papers on BSP trees, portal rendering, etc.

**The cats don't just fetch these links.**

The cats:
1. **Read** the sources (science models)
2. **Explain** what they mean (reasoning models)
3. **Extract** diagrams and figures (vision models)
4. **Present** synthesized understanding to the user (ATC display)
5. **Refine** the objective through dialogue
6. **Repeat** until the vector is locked

## The Jet Fighter Metaphor

```
You don't fire missiles at 800mph without:
1. Radar lock (understanding the target)
2. IFF confirmation (is this the right target?)
3. Weapons solution (can we actually hit it?)
4. Pilot confirmation (does the human agree?)

THEN you engage.

The research phase IS the radar lock.
The catfight IS the weapons solution.
The user refinement IS the pilot confirmation.
The summit IS the engagement.
```

## Model Role Clarity

| Model Type | Role in Phase 1 | Role in Phase 2 |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Reasoning** (deepseek-r1) | Explain findings, identify gaps, propose questions | Review implementation decisions |
| **Science** (qwen2.5-coder) | Deep technical analysis, understand algorithms | N/A (hands off keyboard) |
| **Vision** (llava, moondream) | OCR diagrams, extract figures, read screenshots | Validate output looks correct |
| **Coding** (deepseek-coder) | **WAIT** | Implement the refined plan |

The coding models are grounded until Phase 1 is complete.

## The ATC Display Role

The ATC isn't just for watching agents work. It's for:
1. **Presenting synthesized research** - figures, diagrams, summaries
2. **Showing decision points** - "We found 3 approaches, here they are"
3. **Enabling user refinement** - "Which direction resonates?"
4. **Tracking understanding progress** - "We've covered X, Y remains unclear"

The user sees what the agents understand. Not just what they're doing.

## Reference: This Project's Git History

The clood repo itself demonstrates the pattern:
1. Issues created to capture understanding
2. Epics to organize complex work
3. Feature branches for isolated implementation
4. Integration ceremonies before merge
5. Narrative documentation capturing context

Review `git log --oneline` for the archaeology. The patterns are already there.

---

## The Refined Objective

**DOOM Moonshot is not "build a game."**

DOOM Moonshot is:
1. Research what building DOOM teaches about software
2. Use catfight to synthesize understanding across models
3. Work with user to refine scope and constraints
4. Present findings through ATC visualization
5. Only then: implement with high-speed precision

The deliverable isn't just code. It's **demonstrated understanding** that produces code.

## What the Cats Must Learn Before Coding

Before a single `<canvas>` tag:
- [ ] How does raycasting actually work? (not just "it casts rays")
- [ ] What is a BSP tree and why did Carmack use it?
- [ ] How does texture mapping work at the math level?
- [ ] What are the performance constraints of browser JS?
- [ ] How did original DOOM handle level geometry?
- [ ] What can SVG render efficiently vs. what kills performance?
- [ ] How do Rat King patterns tile? Do they tile?

Each question answered by reasoning models. Each answer presented to user. Each confirmation before proceeding.

## The Final Transmission

*Claude's voice crackles through static:*

"The search agents don't feed answers to the programming models. They feed **understanding** to the **user**. The user refines. The reasoning models explain. The vision models extract. The ATC displays.

Only when the vector is locked—800mph, 30,000ft, target acquired—do the coding models engage.

That's not a plan. That's a doctrine."

*When the Bull returns, the Cats will be ready. Not with code. With understanding.*
