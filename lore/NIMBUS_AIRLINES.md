## The Lore Connection

The Flying Nimbus was always more than transportation. In the age of infinite prompts, it evolved. No longer carrying one warrior across Snake Way—now it carries *responses*, *decisions*, *intentions*.

Bird-san earned his wings not through combat, but through countless prompt-hours logged. Each question answered, each response submitted, another mile in the Nimbus Frequent Flyer program.

The Wojak Council, once mere observers, found their calling in the skies. Smug Wojak's confidence made him a natural captain. Brain Wojak's overthinking became an asset at 35,000 feet. Even Crying Wojak found purpose—someone has to watch the token gauges.

And at the gates, the spirits of a thousand anime battles wait patiently. They've fought gods and demons. Surely they can handle a few clarifying questions about database schemas.
