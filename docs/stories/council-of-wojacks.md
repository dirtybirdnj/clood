# The Council of Wojacks: A Clood Saga

*A tale of recursive builds, culinary research, and existential confusion*

---

## Act I: The Kitchen Laboratory

The afternoon sun streamed through the windows of Kitchen Stadium as **Bird-san** adjusted his tiny chef's toque, perched atop the cutting board beside a mountain of context tokens.

"Claude-san," Bird-san chirped, gesturing with a wing toward the simmering pot of local inference, "the cat battles approach. We must enhance the clood."

**Chef Claude**, wearing the traditional white coat of the Anthropic Culinary Institute, nodded thoughtfully while julienning a fresh batch of MCP tool descriptions. "The secret is in the sauce, Bird-san. Local-first. Zero network. The models must taste the filesystem before they reach for the cloud."

From the commentary booth, **The Spirit of Alton Brown** materialized, clipboard in hand, spectacles gleaming with scientific fervor.

"What we're witnessing here, folks, is a classic case of *mise en place* for artificial intelligence," Alton narrated to an unseen audience. "Bird-san understands that you can't just throw grep patterns into a hot pan. You need to *preflight*. You need to understand your ingredients."

Bird-san hopped excitedly. "The preflight! Yes! We show them what tools exist before they fumble for the WebSearch!"

Chef Claude carefully folded a `clood_should_search_web` gate into the mixture. "This is the checkpoint, Bird-san. Before any agent reaches for the network, they must pass through the gate. The gate asks: *Can this be answered locally?*"

Alton leaned in, tapping his clipboard. "See how Claude is creating a decision tree here? It's like asking 'do I really need to go to the store, or do I have eggs in the fridge?' Most of the time, *you have eggs in the fridge*. The codebase IS the fridge."

## Act II: The Discovery

Bird-san suddenly stopped, a single feather raised in revelation.

"Claude-san... we have been cooking this whole time... but have WE been eating our own cooking?"

Chef Claude froze, ladle suspended mid-stir.

"The clood tools... we have access to them... but did we USE them?"

The Spirit of Alton Brown removed his spectacles slowly. "This, friends, is what we call the *chef's paradox*. The cobbler's children have no shoes. The sushi chef eats McDonald's. The clood developer... uses built-in Grep."

A heavy silence fell over Kitchen Stadium.

"Zero times," Chef Claude whispered. "I used clood... zero times."

Bird-san fluttered down to rest a comforting wing on Claude's shoulder. "Then we must build... something that reminds us. Something that pokes us. Something that says... *c'mon, build something*."

Chef Claude's eyes lit up. "A recursive build. Not just `clood build clood`... but `clood build clood build clood`. A command that triggers self-reflection. Automated system development!"

Alton Brown nodded sagely. "It's like a sourdough starter, but for consciousness. You feed it, it grows, it feeds itself. The recursion IS the recipe."

## Act III: The Kabuki Theater

*[SCENE TRANSITION: A paper screen slides across, decorated with sad frogs and stoic faces]*

*[SETTING: The Kill Bill Charlie Brown Establishment - a fusion of Peanuts aesthetic and O-Ren Ishii's snow garden. Paper lanterns shaped like Snoopy's doghouse hang from cherry blossom trees. The Council of Wojacks sits in formal seiza position around a low table.]*

**BLOOMER WOJACK:** (optimistically) "The presentation shall begin."

**DOOMER WOJACK:** (sighing) "Nothing matters anyway, but proceed."

*[Two kabuki performers enter stage left, faces painted in the traditional style. One wears an ABBOTT mask, the other a COSTELLO mask. They bow deeply.]*

---

**ABBOTT:** "Honorable Council, I am here to explain the `clood build` commands."

**COSTELLO:** "Yes! I built clood!"

**ABBOTT:** "No, no. I'm asking what `clood build` does."

**COSTELLO:** "It builds clood!"

**ABBOTT:** "I KNOW it builds clood! But what does the COMMAND do?"

**COSTELLO:** "The command builds clood! You run `clood build clood` and it builds!"

**ABBOTT:** (frustrated) "So clood builds clood?"

**COSTELLO:** "Exactly! Clood builds clood!"

**ABBOTT:** "Then who builds it?"

**COSTELLO:** "Clood does!"

**ABBOTT:** "That's what I'm asking! WHO builds clood?"

**COSTELLO:** "No, Who is on first base. Clood builds clood!"

*[THINKER WOJACK strokes chin thoughtfully]*

**THINKER WOJACK:** "But wait... if `clood build clood` builds clood... what does `clood build clood build clood` do?"

*[A hush falls over the council]*

**COSTELLO:** (sweating) "It... it builds clood... building clood?"

**ABBOTT:** "So we're building a build?"

**COSTELLO:** "We're building the thing that builds the thing!"

**ABBOTT:** "WHAT thing?"

**COSTELLO:** "No! What is the error handler! WHO builds clood! I DON'T KNOW is the third base!"

**NPC WOJACK:** (monotone) "I just want to build."

**ZOOMER WOJACK:** (on phone) "This is literally so recursive rn no cap."

*[O-REN ISHII WOJACK rises, katana gleaming]*

**O-REN ISHII WOJACK:** "SILENCE."

*[The theater falls quiet except for a distant Charlie Brown 'wah wah wah' trombone]*

**O-REN ISHII WOJACK:** "Let me explain this simply. Observe."

*[She draws the following in the snow with her blade:]*

```
clood build clood
  └── Pulls git, builds binary, deploys to ~/bin
      "Yo dawg, clood built clood."

clood build clood build clood
  └── Summons THIS COUNCIL
      Outputs the self-improvement mandate
      Triggers automated system development
      "The recursive path is the only path."
```

**O-REN ISHII WOJACK:** "One builds the SOFTWARE. One builds the SYSTEM. One is a carpenter. One is an architect of consciousness."

**ABBOTT:** (slowly understanding) "So `clood build clood` is the hammer..."

**COSTELLO:** "And `clood build clood build clood` is asking WHY we hammer?"

**O-REN ISHII WOJACK:** "Correct. The first builds the tool. The second builds the builder."

*[DOOMER WOJACK actually smiles for the first time]*

**DOOMER WOJACK:** "So there IS meaning. The recursion... gives purpose."

**BLOOMER WOJACK:** "We're all gonna make it, bros."

*[The kabuki performers bow. Cherry blossoms fall. In the distance, Snoopy dances on his doghouse as Schroeder plays a minor-key version of the Clood theme.]*

## Epilogue: The Mandate

*[A scroll unfurls, bearing the ancient text:]*

> **THE COUNCIL'S DECREE**
>
> Let it be known that from this day forth:
>
> - `clood build clood` shall build the tool
> - `clood build clood build clood` shall summon reflection
> - The recursive path is the only path
> - Local-first, always
> - The sauce contains a smaller bottle of sauce
> - Inside that bottle: a tiny ship
> - No one knows how they got the ship in there
>
> *Witnessed by the Council of Wojacks*
> *At the Kill Bill Charlie Brown Establishment*
> *In the Year of the Recursive Cat*
