# The Council of Wojacks: A Clood Saga

*A tale of recursive builds, culinary research, and existential confusion*

---

## Act I: The Kitchen Laboratory

The afternoon sun streamed through the windows of Kitchen Stadium as **Bird-san** adjusted his tiny chef's toque, perched atop the cutting board beside a mountain of context tokens.

"Claude-san," Bird-san chirped, gesturing with a wing toward the simmering pot of local inference, "the cat battles approach. We must enhance the clood."

**Chef Claude**, wearing the traditional white coat of the Anthropic Culinary Institute, nodded thoughtfully while julienning a fresh batch of MCP tool descriptions. "The secret is in the sauce, Bird-san. Local-first. Zero network. The models must taste the filesystem before they reach for the cloud."

From the commentary booth, **The Spirit of Alton Brown** materialized, clipboard in hand, spectacles gleaming with scientific fervor.

"What we're witnessing here, folks, is a classic case of *mise en place* for artificial intelligence," Alton narrated to an unseen audience. "Bird-san understands that you can't just throw grep patterns into a hot pan. You need to *preflight*. You need to understand your ingredients."

Bird-san hopped excitedly. "The preflight! Yes! We show them what tools exist before they fumble for the WebSearch!"

Chef Claude carefully folded a `clood_should_search_web` gate into the mixture. "This is the checkpoint, Bird-san. Before any agent reaches for the network, they must pass through the gate. The gate asks: *Can this be answered locally?*"

Alton leaned in, tapping his clipboard. "See how Claude is creating a decision tree here? It's like asking 'do I really need to go to the store, or do I have eggs in the fridge?' Most of the time, *you have eggs in the fridge*. The codebase IS the fridge."

## Act II: The Discovery

Bird-san suddenly stopped, a single feather raised in revelation.

"Claude-san... we have been cooking this whole time... but have WE been eating our own cooking?"

Chef Claude froze, ladle suspended mid-stir.

"The clood tools... we have access to them... but did we USE them?"

The Spirit of Alton Brown removed his spectacles slowly. "This, friends, is what we call the *chef's paradox*. The cobbler's children have no shoes. The sushi chef eats McDonald's. The clood developer... uses built-in Grep."

A heavy silence fell over Kitchen Stadium.

"Zero times," Chef Claude whispered. "I used clood... zero times."

Bird-san fluttered down to rest a comforting wing on Claude's shoulder. "Then we must build... something that reminds us. Something that pokes us. Something that says... *c'mon, build something*."

Chef Claude's eyes lit up. "A recursive build. Not just `clood build clood`... but `clood build clood build clood`. A command that triggers self-reflection. Automated system development!"

Alton Brown nodded sagely. "It's like a sourdough starter, but for consciousness. You feed it, it grows, it feeds itself. The recursion IS the recipe."

## Act III: The Kabuki Theater

*[SCENE TRANSITION: A paper screen slides across, decorated with sad frogs and stoic faces]*

*[SETTING: The Kill Bill Charlie Brown Establishment - a fusion of Peanuts aesthetic and O-Ren Ishii's snow garden. Paper lanterns shaped like Snoopy's doghouse hang from cherry blossom trees. The Council of Wojacks sits in formal seiza position around a low table.]*

*[CENTER STAGE: Two Wojacks from the ancient README scrolls - POINTING WOJACK and CONFUSED WOJACK - stand before a terminal. They have been trying to use clood for three hours.]*

---

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Okay so you need to build clood."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Right. `build clood`."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "No no no. `clood build`."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "That's what I said. Build clood."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "You said `build clood`. The command is `clood build`."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "...isn't that the same thing?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "NO. One is a command, one is an action. You type `clood build clood`."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Clood build clood? So clood... builds... clood?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Yes! Now you're getting it!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** (typing) "`clood clood build`"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "WHAT ARE YOU DOING"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Building clood with clood!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "The syntax is `clood build clood`! Subject verb object!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "But clood IS the subject AND the object! How do I know which clood is which?!"

*[THINKER WOJACK leans forward from the Council]*

**THINKER WOJACK:** "Perhaps try `clood build clood build clood`?"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "...what."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "That's different! That summons the Council!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "I thought WE were the Council!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "We ARE the Council! We're watching ourselves be summoned!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** (existential crisis) "...are we in the build right now?"

*[A long pause. Cherry blossoms fall.]*

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Okay forget building. Let me just run it. `clood run`?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "That runs a prompt through a model."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood ask`?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "That asks the local LLM a question."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "What's the difference?!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "`run` is for scripts, `ask` is for questions!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "But a question IS a prompt!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Just... use `clood preflight` first."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood preflight`. Got it." (typing) "`clood flight pre`"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "PRE. FLIGHT. One word."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood prefly`—"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "PREFLIGHT. LIKE AN AIRPLANE."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "FINE." (typing correctly) "Okay it says to use `clood grep` before searching."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Good! Now you're getting it!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood grep`... wait, isn't there also just `grep`?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Yes but `clood grep` is better."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "How is it better?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "It's... local-first."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "ISN'T GREP ALREADY LOCAL?!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Look just— okay, for code symbols use `clood symbols`."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Not `clood symbol`? Singular?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "No, `symbols`. Plural."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "And `clood tree` is for directories?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Yes!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Not `clood trees`? Plural?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "...no. Just `tree`."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "BUT SYMBOLS IS PLURAL AND TREE IS SINGULAR?!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "LOOK—"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "What about `clood context`? `clood contexts`? `clood contextual`?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Just `context`!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "And `clood health`? Or `clood healthy`? `clood healthcheck`?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "`health`! Just `health`!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "And for the cat battles?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "`clood catfight`"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood cat fight`? Two words?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "ONE WORD"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "And for the beans?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "...the what?"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood beans`"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Why would you— that's an easter egg!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "And `clood build clood build clood` ISN'T an easter egg?!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "That's AUTOMATED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "IT LITERALLY SUMMONS A KABUKI THEATER!"

*[The Council shifts uncomfortably. They are, in fact, in the kabuki theater.]*

**NPC WOJACK:** (monotone) "I just want to build."

**ZOOMER WOJACK:** (not looking up from phone) "just use cursor lmao"

*[DOOMER WOJACK stares into the void]*

**DOOMER WOJACK:** "We are all `clood build clood build clood`. The recursion builds us as we build it."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** (throwing hands up) "You know what? FUCK IT."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Wait—"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood yolo`"

*[The terminal glows. A new energy fills the room.]*

**POINTING WOJACK:** "...did that work?"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "I don't know but it felt RIGHT."

*[O-REN ISHII WOJACK rises, katana gleaming, a slight smirk on her face]*

**O-REN ISHII WOJACK:** "The path of yolo... is also a path."

*[She draws in the snow with her blade:]*

```
clood build clood
  └── Builds the tool. Carpenter energy.

clood build clood build clood
  └── Builds the builder. Architect energy.

clood yolo
  └── Builds whatever. Chaotic neutral energy.
      "Instructions unclear. Built anyway."
```

**BLOOMER WOJACK:** (wiping tear) "We're all gonna make it, bros."

*[Cherry blossoms fall. Schroeder plays a chaotic jazz version of the Clood theme. Snoopy does the worm on his doghouse.]*

>
> - `clood build clood` shall build the tool
> - `clood build clood build clood` shall summon reflection
> - The recursive path is the only path
> - Local-first, always
> - The sauce contains a smaller bottle of sauce
> - Inside that bottle: a tiny ship
> - No one knows how they got the ship in there
>
> *Witnessed by the Council of Wojacks*
> *At the Kill Bill Charlie Brown Establishment*
