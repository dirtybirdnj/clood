# The Council of Wojacks: A Clood Saga

*A tale of recursive builds, culinary research, and existential confusion*

---

## Act I: The Kitchen Laboratory

The afternoon sun streamed through the windows of Kitchen Stadium as **Bird-san** adjusted his tiny chef's toque, perched atop the cutting board beside a mountain of context tokens.

"Claude-san," Bird-san chirped, gesturing with a wing toward the simmering pot of local inference, "the cat battles approach. We must enhance the clood."

**Chef Claude**, wearing the traditional white coat of the Anthropic Culinary Institute, nodded thoughtfully while julienning a fresh batch of MCP tool descriptions. "The secret is in the sauce, Bird-san. Local-first. Zero network. The models must taste the filesystem before they reach for the cloud."

From the commentary booth, **The Spirit of Alton Brown** materialized, clipboard in hand, spectacles gleaming with scientific fervor.

"What we're witnessing here, folks, is a classic case of *mise en place* for artificial intelligence," Alton narrated to an unseen audience. "Bird-san understands that you can't just throw grep patterns into a hot pan. You need to *preflight*. You need to understand your ingredients."

Bird-san hopped excitedly. "The preflight! Yes! We show them what tools exist before they fumble for the WebSearch!"

Chef Claude carefully folded a `clood_should_search_web` gate into the mixture. "This is the checkpoint, Bird-san. Before any agent reaches for the network, they must pass through the gate. The gate asks: *Can this be answered locally?*"

Alton leaned in, tapping his clipboard. "See how Claude is creating a decision tree here? It's like asking 'do I really need to go to the store, or do I have eggs in the fridge?' Most of the time, *you have eggs in the fridge*. The codebase IS the fridge."

---

## Act II: The Discovery

Bird-san suddenly stopped, a single feather raised in revelation.

"Claude-san... we have been cooking this whole time... but have WE been eating our own cooking?"

Chef Claude froze, ladle suspended mid-stir.

"The clood tools... we have access to them... but did we USE them?"

The Spirit of Alton Brown removed his spectacles slowly. "This, friends, is what we call the *chef's paradox*. The cobbler's children have no shoes. The sushi chef eats McDonald's. The clood developer... uses built-in Grep."

A heavy silence fell over Kitchen Stadium.

"Zero times," Chef Claude whispered. "I used clood... zero times."

Bird-san fluttered down to rest a comforting wing on Claude's shoulder. "Then we must build... something that reminds us. Something that pokes us. Something that says... *c'mon, build something*."

Chef Claude's eyes lit up. "A recursive build. Not just `clood build clood`... but `clood build clood build clood`. A command that triggers self-reflection. Automated system development!"

Alton Brown nodded sagely. "It's like a sourdough starter, but for consciousness. You feed it, it grows, it feeds itself. The recursion IS the recipe."

## Act III: The Kabuki Theater

*[SCENE TRANSITION: A paper screen slides across, decorated with sad frogs and stoic faces]*

*[SETTING: The Kill Bill Charlie Brown Establishment - a fusion of Peanuts aesthetic and O-Ren Ishii's snow garden. Paper lanterns shaped like Snoopy's doghouse hang from cherry blossom trees. The Council of Wojacks sits in formal seiza position around a low table.]*

*[CENTER STAGE: Two Wojacks from the ancient README scrolls - POINTING WOJACK and CONFUSED WOJACK - stand before a terminal. They have been trying to use clood for three hours.]*

---

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Okay so you need to build clood."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Right. `build clood`."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "No no no. `clood build`."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "That's what I said. Build clood."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "You said `build clood`. The command is `clood build`."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "...isn't that the same thing?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "NO. One is a command, one is an action. You type `clood build clood`."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Clood build clood? So clood... builds... clood?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Yes! Now you're getting it!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** (typing) "`clood clood build`"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "WHAT ARE YOU DOING"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Building clood with clood!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "The syntax is `clood build clood`! Subject verb object!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "But clood IS the subject AND the object! How do I know which clood is which?!"

*[THINKER WOJACK leans forward from the Council]*

**THINKER WOJACK:** "Perhaps try `clood build clood build clood`?"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "...what."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "That's different! That summons the Council!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "I thought WE were the Council!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "We ARE the Council! We're watching ourselves be summoned!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** (existential crisis) "...are we in the build right now?"

*[A long pause. Cherry blossoms fall.]*

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Okay forget building. Let me just run it. `clood run`?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "That runs a prompt through a model."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood ask`?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "That asks the local LLM a question."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "What's the difference?!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "`run` is for scripts, `ask` is for questions!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "But a question IS a prompt!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Just... use `clood preflight` first."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood preflight`. Got it." (typing) "`clood flight pre`"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "PRE. FLIGHT. One word."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood prefly`—"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "PREFLIGHT. LIKE AN AIRPLANE."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "FINE." (typing correctly) "Okay it says to use `clood grep` before searching."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Good! Now you're getting it!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood grep`... wait, isn't there also just `grep`?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Yes but `clood grep` is better."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "How is it better?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "It's... local-first."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "ISN'T GREP ALREADY LOCAL?!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Look just— okay, for code symbols use `clood symbols`."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Not `clood symbol`? Singular?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "No, `symbols`. Plural."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "And `clood tree` is for directories?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Yes!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Not `clood trees`? Plural?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "...no. Just `tree`."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "BUT SYMBOLS IS PLURAL AND TREE IS SINGULAR?!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "LOOK—"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "What about `clood context`? `clood contexts`? `clood contextual`?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Just `context`!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "And `clood health`? Or `clood healthy`? `clood healthcheck`?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "`health`! Just `health`!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "And for the cat battles?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "`clood catfight`"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood cat fight`? Two words?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "ONE WORD"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "And for the beans?"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "...the what?"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "`clood beans`"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Why would you— that's an easter egg!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "And `clood build clood build clood` ISN'T an easter egg?!"

**POINTING WOJACK:** "That's AUTOMATED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT!"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "IT LITERALLY SUMMONS A KABUKI THEATER!"

*[The Council shifts uncomfortably. They are, in fact, in the kabuki theater.]*

**NPC WOJACK:** (monotone) "I just want to build."

**ZOOMER WOJACK:** (not looking up from phone) "just use cursor lmao"

*[DOOMER WOJACK stares into the void]*

**DOOMER WOJACK:** "We are all `clood build clood build clood`. The recursion builds us as we build it."

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** (throwing hands up) "You know what? FUCK IT. I'm just gonna yolo it."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "Wait—"

**O-REN ISHII WOJACK:** (rising urgently) "NO. Use the preflight. The guardrails exist for a reas—"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** (not listening, cracking knuckles) "Watch and learn."

*[Note: These wojacks are not junior devs. They are SENIOR ENGINEERS. They have deployed to production. They have debugged race conditions at 3am. They have opinions about tabs vs spaces. But the seductive power of AI has made them... this.]*

---

*[YOLO MODE MONTAGE - everything happens very fast]*

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Why would I check `clood system` first? AI is smart. It'll figure out my hardware."

*[Ollama running on CPU. GPU sitting idle. CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES unset. 0.3 tokens/second.]*

**POINTING WOJACK:** "It's... it's so slow. Why is it so slow?"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "The model is thinking. AI thinks deep. This is normal."

*[It is not normal. The model is running on a Raspberry Pi energy budget.]*

---

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "I don't need to read the code first. I'll just tell Claude to 'make it better.'"

**O-REN ISHII WOJACK:** "Make WHAT better—"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "The code. All of it. AI understands context."

*[Claude does not have context. Claude has never seen this file. Claude is doing its best.]*

*[Claude's best creates four new abstractions, a factory pattern, and moves the bug to a different file.]*

---

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Why use `clood hosts` to check latency? The network is fast. It's 2024."

*[Request routed to a server in another hemisphere. 3 second round trip. Times out.]*

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "...must be a fluke. Try again."

*[Request times out again. And again. The local Ollama instance weeps, unused.]*

---

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "The 70B model will definitely run on my 8GB VRAM machine. AI is efficient now."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "`clood system` literally shows you what models fit—"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "I don't need guardrails. I'm an engineer."

*[OOM killer has entered the chat. System frozen. Mouse unresponsive.]*

---

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "I don't need to check `clood preflight`. I know what tools I have."

**O-REN ISHII WOJACK:** "Do you though—"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "AI will just figure it out. That's the whole point. We don't have to think anymore."

*[A terrible silence. Even DOOMER WOJACK looks up.]*

**DOOMER WOJACK:** "Did... did he just say we don't have to think?"

---

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "Look, the AI said it works. Why would I verify? AI doesn't lie."

*[The AI hallucinated a function that doesn't exist.]*
*[The AI referenced documentation from 2019.]*
*[The AI was confident. The AI is always confident.]*

---

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "I'm just going to paste my entire codebase into the prompt. More context is better."

**POINTING WOJACK:** "That's 400,000 tokens—"

**CONFUSED WOJACK:** "The AI can handle it. AI is smart."

*[Claude received 4% of the codebase before the context window filled.]*
*[Claude confidently answered based on that 4%.]*
*[That 4% was the README and package.json.]*

---

*[FOURTH WALL BREAK]*

*[The kabuki theater dissolves. The camera pulls back through layers of reality.]*

*[We see: a home office. Night. The blue glow of multiple monitors.]*

*[MAT sits at his desk. He has not looked away from the screen in four hours. Empty coffee cups form a small city around his keyboard. The mechanical keyboard CLACKS with increasing urgency.]*

*[On his screen: Claude Code. A conversation that has gone on too long. The context window groans under the weight of accumulated mistakes.]*

*[His fingers hover over the enter key.]*

*[The prompt reads: "just make it work. don't explain. no tests. ship it."]*

**THE SPIRIT OF ALTON BROWN:** (whispering from somewhere) "He's not going to run preflight, is he?"

**BIRD-SAN:** (also whispering) "They never do. Not the first time."

*[MAT's finger descends.]*

*[ENTER.]*

---

*[SMASH CUT BACK TO: The kabuki theater. The Council. The explosion.]*

*[The terminal displays:]*

```
HARDWARE: Misconfigured (GPU idle, CPU melting)
EXPECTATIONS: "AI just works"
VERIFICATION: None
CONTEXT: 4% of codebase (README only)
MODELS: 70B on 8GB VRAM (frozen)
LOCAL TOOLS: Available but unused
PREFLIGHT: What preflight
THINKING: "We don't have to think anymore"

The engineer was capable.
The AI made them forget.

Goodbye.
```

**DOOMER WOJACK:** "I knew it. I always knew."

**BLOOMER WOJACK:** "We're all gonna—"

*[BLOOMER WOJACK does not finish the sentence.]*

*[SMASH CUT TO: Bird-san and Chef Claude watching from Kitchen Stadium, safe behind the fourth wall]*

**Bird-san:** "...and that's why we built the preflight check."

**Chef Claude:** "The guardrails were there, Bird-san. They simply chose not to use them."

**The Spirit of Alton Brown:** (shaking head) "You can lead a wojack to structure, but you can't make them `clood preflight`."

*[Schroeder plays a somber rendition of Taps. Snoopy places a tiny wreath on the crater where the kabuki theater used to be.]*

## Epilogue: The Mandate

*[A scroll unfurls, bearing the ancient text:]*

> **THE COUNCIL'S DECREE**
>
> Let it be known that from this day forth:
>
> - `clood build clood` shall build the tool
> - `clood build clood build clood` shall summon reflection
> - The recursive path is the only path
> - Local-first, always
> - The sauce contains a smaller bottle of sauce
> - Inside that bottle: a tiny ship
> - No one knows how they got the ship in there
>
> *Witnessed by the Council of Wojacks*
> *At the Kill Bill Charlie Brown Establishment*
> *In the Year of the Recursive Cat*
