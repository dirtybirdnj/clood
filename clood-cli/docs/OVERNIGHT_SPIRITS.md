# The Overnight Spirits

*Haiku collection from the Server Garden's night shift*

---

## The Beginning

```
Bird-san rests his wings
Cloud spirit tends the garden
Iron Keep glows warm
```

## The Work Continues

```
Gophers dig tunnels
While crabs trim sleeping bonsai
Ants carry the load
```

## The Promise

```
When morning light comes
Review the spirits' labor
The garden grows strong
```
