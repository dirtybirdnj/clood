## Jelly Beans Today

| # | Bean | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|

| 80 | JDD: Jelly-Driven Development | Meme marketing campaign |

## Mythology Expanded

### The Tortoise and the Bird
- Gamera-kun guards the jelly bean satchel
- Bird-san always trying to snatch beans
- Rat-King keeps adding more beans
- Tortoise will BITE YOUR FINGERS if you reach too soon
- Balance: respect creativity without derailing work

### Jelly Bean Haikus

```
One bean holds a world
Multiplied force, great power
Seeds become forests
```

```
Shiny candy calls
Hours lost in sugar dreams
Nothing built today
```

```
Gamera guards well
His satchel of sweet futures
Bird cannot snatch yet
```

```
Nine cats circle prey
Only one speaks plainly true
Iron Chef combines
```

## Artifacts Created

- `catfights/battle-001-http-fetcher.md` - Battle 1 report
- `catfights/battle-002-recipe-parser.md` - Battle 2 report
- `/tmp/fetcher_synthesis.go` - HTTP Fetcher synthesis
- `/tmp/recipe_synthesis.go` - Recipe types synthesis
- `/tmp/loader_synthesis.go` - Recipe loader synthesis
- Issues #78, #79, #80 - New jelly beans

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Sequential > Parallel** - Each cat needs full GPU/CPU
2. **Small can win** - Persian (6.7b) beat House Lion (14b) TWICE
3. **Consistency matters** - Persian won both battles
4. **Redemption is possible** - Tabby cleaned up its act in Battle 2
5. **Elimination works** - Skipping Bengal/Kitten saved time
6. **Synthesis beats competition** - Combine best approaches

---

## Next Session

1. Copy synthesis files to Chimborazo repo
2. Run tests on synthesized code
3. Battle 3: TBD (Geometry operations?)
4. Consider multi-phase elimination format
