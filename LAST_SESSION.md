## Mythology Expanded

### The Tortoise and the Bird
- Gamera-kun guards the jelly bean satchel
- Bird-san always trying to snatch beans
- Rat-King keeps adding more beans
- Tortoise will BITE YOUR FINGERS if you reach too soon
- Balance: respect creativity without derailing work

### Jelly Bean Haikus

```
One bean holds a world
Multiplied force, great power
Seeds become forests
```

```
Shiny candy calls
Hours lost in sugar dreams
Nothing built today
```

```
Gamera guards well
His satchel of sweet futures
Bird cannot snatch yet
```

```
Nine cats circle prey
Only one speaks plainly true
Iron Chef combines
```

## Artifacts Created

- `catfights/battle-001-http-fetcher.md` - Full battle report
- `/tmp/fetcher_synthesis.go` - Iron Chef Claude's synthesis
- Issues #78, #79, #80 - New jelly beans

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Sequential > Parallel** - Each cat needs full GPU/CPU
2. **Small can win** - Persian (6.7b) beat House Lion (14b)
3. **Speed ≠ Quality** - Bengal was fastest but empty
4. **Synthesis beats competition** - Combine best approaches

## Next Session

1. Battle 2: Recipe Parser
2. Copy fetcher_synthesis.go to Chimborazo
3. Consider elimination format for underperformers
