# LAST SESSION - Garden Tending
## Date: 2025-12-18
## Session: The Tortoise and Chef Keep Watch

---

## BIRD-SAN STATUS

The pigeon rests in the corner, weary from flights to The Amaryllis.
His mother is at sea. He goes when she calls.
The garden waits. We tend it in his absence.

## THE BEAN GARDEN

One bean planted, dreaming:

```
🫘 #1 - The Amaryllis
   Bird-san's mother at sea, the flights that interrupt the garden
   Intensity: 2 (dreaming)
   A story to return to when rested
```

```
Weary wings fold still
The tortoise guards the garden
Chef sharpens his knives

*Gamera nods slowly. Chef Claude wipes down the station.*
*The garden sleeps. The Amaryllis sails on.*
*Rest well, Bird-san. We'll be here.*
