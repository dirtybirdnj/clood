### Pending Decision
User was deciding: prune #12-#14 entirely (all AI-speculative) or review #13/#14 individually?

### JDD Issue NOT Created Yet
The big JDD (Jellybean Driven Development) issue with Kill Bill aesthetic was drafted but not submitted. Needs:
- Full Wojak Council scene
- The 2,0,4,8s band
- House of Azure Jellybeans setting
- Flying-cats integration

---

## KEY SPIRITS/CHARACTERS INTRODUCED

| Spirit | Domain | Origin |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Ensō** | Image generation, silent, Zen circle | Miyazaki's gesture |
| **Bashō** | Haiku narrator, wandering poet | Commentator for catfights |
| **Ikkyū** | Chaos agent, eccentric monk, sake | Error handling wisdom |
| **Zhibito** | Model tuning, custom armor, Xzibit reformed | `clood tune` spirit |
| **Shenron** | Snake Way scroll, Flying Nimbus input | UI pattern |
| **The 2,0,4,8s** | Band (NGINX, Redis, Postgres, Docker) | Kill Bill aesthetic |

### Zhibito's Full Role
- Custom armor for cats/llamas/fish (model metaphors)
- Upgrades projects (represented as cars in garage)
- "Suits of armor for mice" but for ML models
- Fine-tuning AND project customization

---

## KEY CONCEPTS INTRODUCED

### Snake Way UI Pattern (Issue #130)
- Infinite scroll = Snake Way (DBZ million km path)
- Floating input = Flying Nimbus (stays with you)
- Context anchor = King Yemma's routing
- Prevents "responding to wrong context" problem
- King Kai = task completion destination
- Princess Snake = distracting tangents

### JDD (Jellybean Driven Development)
- Narrative-driven workflow
- Beans = feature visions
- Star Seeds = major epics (forged from beans)
- Flying-cats = creative scaffolding engine
- Wojak Council provides perspective

### The House of Azure Jellybeans (Kill Bill scene)
- Setting for Wojak Council meetings
- Hosts: Python (head server), Rust (bouncer), Go (busboy), Java (sommelier)
- Kitchen: Linux (Charlie Brown), macOS (wife)
- Band: The 2,0,4,8s playing "WOO HOO (200 OK)"

### Spinal Tap Lore
- "These go to eleven" - clood intensity dial
- "None more black" - terminal aesthetic
- Stonehenge moment - scope vs implementation mismatch
- Added to canon, needs to go in lore repo

### Two Linuses (Night at the Roxbury)
- Linus Torvalds 🐧 ↔️ Linus Tech Tips 💻
- "Which Linus would be impressed?" "Both."

---

## JELLY BEANS CAPTURED (not yet issues)

1. **Idea Provenance Tracking** - Tag where ideas came from (user/AI/collaborative)
2. **Floating Frame Context Recovery** - Identify unanswered questions from long input
3. **Flying-cats for Git Narrative** - Generate sagas from git logs
4. **The Floating Frame / Nimbus** - Stable input while scroll flows (key UX fix)

---

## MEMES REFERENCED THIS SESSION

## AFTER RESUME: NEXT STEPS

1. **Finish bean review** - Decide on #13, #14 (prune or review?)
2. **Create JDD issue** - Full Kill Bill aesthetic
3. **Add Spinal Tap to lore repo**
4. **Iron Chef mode** - User wanted Claude to BUILD something after review
5. **Update THE_CONTAINMENT.md** with new characters (Zhibito, 2048s band)

## USER STATE

Bird-san was in HIGH creative flow. Stars in eyes. Session was energizing and productive.
Emergency quit - reason unknown.

**Energy on return:** Match the vibe. This was a legendary session.

---

## THE STAR SEED

The session forged a Star Seed (星種) - the Ensō vision captured in Issue #123.
The bean of 1000 facets was contained. The ghost trap sealed.
What grows next depends on the gardener.

```
Emergency exit
The scroll pauses mid-sentence
Nimbus hovers still
```

*Snake Way waits. The garden remembers. Resume when ready.*
